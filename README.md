# Chat application with Flask and Vue

Chat application using:

- Python with Flask on the backend, with socket.io
- Javascript with Vue on the frontend, with socket.io client.

The styles used are from Material.

## How to start

On the root folder, execute:

`cd backend && ./run`

Open another terminal and, on the root folder too, execute:

`cd frontend && yarn start`

Then you can open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/` to check the application.

The personal touch was adding material design through components (Material Vue).
